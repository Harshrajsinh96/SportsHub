Many students and young adults love to play outdoor games on the weekends with friends, but sometimes their friends are not free to play with them. This application allows users to signup and gain access to local available games in the area. The application has a stored database of all public play areas. The application can also track data (location and time) from user inputs of available matches, which then sends notifications to available players within the area. The application has an available games page which shows all available games within the area of the user.
